# canvas_lib

Goal: Create a library to render or generate images in C++

### How do I use this code?

You can use `-I libimg *.cpp` with `g++` to include the source files of the library in your project.

### TODO

 * Built in support for creating image files (right now stdout just gets redirected to a `.ppm` file)
 * Full API for basic shapes, lines & other canvas-like functionality (inspiration from HTML5 canvas & [the Processing library](https://processing.org/))
 * Full documentation
