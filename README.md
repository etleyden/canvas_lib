# canvas_lib

Goal: Create a library to render or generate images in C++

### TODO

 * Built in support for creating image files (right now stdout just gets redirected to a `.ppm` file)
 * Full API for basic shapes, lines & other canvas-like functionality (inspiration from HTML5 canvas & (the Processing library)[https://processing.org/])
 * Full documentation
